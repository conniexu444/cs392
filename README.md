# CS392
## Taken at Stevens Institute of Technology
This course is taught in C and Bash is taught in this course as well. This repository is sorted as the following:
### Practices 
  - [Basic C](practices/practice2.c)
  - [Writing into a specific byte at a file](practices/task3.c)
  - [Creating a dynamic library practice](practices/cs392_sum)
### Homework
  - [hw1](hw/hw1): Creating your own printf function in c
  - [hw2](hw/hw2): 
    - [Task 1](hw/hw2/cat.c): Implement a simplified version of the “cat” shell command, which reads all contents from the input file and prints the data to the standard output. 
    - [Task 2](hw/hw2/sort.c): You are given a file with a sequence of unsorted integers. These integers are saved in the format of strings (strings of digits) and each line represents one integer (maximal value 4294967296). After reading those strings, your program needs to transform them into integers (transfer each string into an integer which can be saved in a variable of type “int”), sort those integers, and save them to another file as strings. Each integer string should take one line in the output file.
